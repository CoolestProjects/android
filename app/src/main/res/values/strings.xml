    <string name="about_first_descr"><![CDATA[<p>The awards were created in 2012 to deliver and support the following principles:</p>     <ul> <li>Creativity</li> <li>Innovation</li> <li>Entrepreneurship</li> <li>The introduction and showcasing of different aspects of STEM education through coding.</li> </ul> <p>The Coolest Projects awards are unique in Europe and were established on a voluntary basis by a number of industry professionals as both a competition and exhibition to support and inspire a generation of innovators, creators and entrepreneurs aged from 7 to 17. The awards, which are now in their fourth year, create a unique platform for young people to develop a broad set of digital abilities by offering them the opportunity to showcase the skills they have learned at CoderDojo.</p>]]></string>
    <string name="about_second_descr"><![CDATA[<p>These digital skills are vital if Ireland, and indeed Europe, is to address the coding skills shortage which has led to in excess of 500,000 open job postings across the continent in 2015.</p> <p>Coolest Projects has seen young people deliver projects across the latest technologies, from Cloud, to Internet of Things (IoT) to Virtual Reality and has the potential to drive vital digital skills across a European platform.</p> <p>This year&#8217;s Coolest Projects awards featured more than 500 entries from young people across Ireland and beyond and attracted more than 5,000 spectators to witness demonstrations of this year&#8217;s submissions. And we estimate that we will have over 800 entries to the 2016 awards and up to 10,000 attendees.</p>]]></string>
    <string name="about_third_descr"><![CDATA[<p>Although the showcase event is held in Ballsbridge, the awards are a Europe-wide event, with participants from the UK, Poland, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Romania and Turkey. CoderDojo currently operates in 16 European countries and by 2017 our target is to have Coolest Projects from every European country with a CoderDojo involved.</p>]]></string>
